# AEON: A Local-First Multi-Modal AI System

## Introduction

AEON is more than just a toolâ€”it's a philosophical framework for an AI. The name itself is an anacronym for its core principles: **A**gentic **E**volutionary **O**mniscient **N**uminous.

### The AEON Anacronym: Core Principles

* **Agentic**: AEON is designed to be proactive and self-determined. It possesses a sense of agency, capable of making choices and acting to produce a desired effect, rather than being a passive tool.
* **Evolutionary**: This system is not static. It embodies a process of continual adaptation and growth, learning from new information and environments to become more effective over time.
* **Omniscient**: While not truly all-knowing, AEON strives for comprehensive knowledge. Its integrated components allow it to draw from a vast base of information, providing a broad and deep understanding of the world.
* **Numinous**: AEON is designed to evoke a sense of awe and wonder. Its ability to combine logical understanding with creative generation gives it a transcendent, almost spiritual quality.

## Technical Architecture: Embedded Components

AEON is a sophisticated multi-modal AI, integrating three specialized models to handle different types of data:

* **Small LLM (Large Language Model)**
    * **Function**: The textual "brain" of the system.
    * **Capabilities**: Processes, understands, summarizes, and generates human-like text. It is optimized for local performance, balancing power with efficiency.

* **VLM (Vision-Language Model)**
    * **Function**: The system's "eyes".
    * **Capabilities**: Allows the AI to "see" and interpret images. By linking visual data with language, it can describe scenes, answer visual queries, and identify objects within pictures.

* **Stable Diffusion (Image Generator)**
    * **Function**: The creative "artist".
    * **Capabilities**: Generates high-quality images from text prompts. It translates textual descriptions into unique visual art, giving the system a powerful creative output.

## How It Works: The CPU-First, Local Approach

What truly sets AEON apart is its commitment to being accessible to everyone. It is specifically optimized for **low-end PCs and CPU-only systems**, eliminating the need for expensive, high-end GPUs. This is achieved through a unique technical stack that prioritizes maximum accessibility and performance.

### Knowledge and Comprehension
To ensure AEON's knowledge is not static, the system integrates advanced methods for information retrieval:

* **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: This framework allows AEON to go beyond its pre-trained knowledge. It can search and retrieve information from a curated knowledge base (local documents, databases) and use this context to generate more accurate and up-to-date responses. This is key for comprehending and explaining **new ideas** that were not part of its original training data.
* **Web Search**: AEON can dynamically **search the web** to get the latest, most relevant information for a given query. This ability to fetch real-time data from external sources ensures that its responses are current, contextually aware, and less prone to "hallucinations."

### Core Technologies
The entire system is powered by a local-first technical stack:

* **Llama.cpp Python Library**: A highly efficient library that enables the entire system to run on a local machine's CPU, bypassing the need for powerful, specialized GPUs or cloud services.
* **GGUF Files**: These are the model's brain and eyes in a highly compressed format. They are quantized versions of the original models, which significantly reduces their file size and memory footprint without a major loss in performance.

This design ensures that AEON is portable, private, and capable of operating fully offline (with the exception of web search). It democratizes access to powerful, dynamic AI capabilities for a wider audience, regardless of their hardware.
